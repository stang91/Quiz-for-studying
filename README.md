# Quiz-for-studying

## Discription
I have always despise studying.  The monotony of flipping through pages of text and trying to understand the concepts, and keywords, truly a bore and snoozefest.  So why not make it fun and interesting by creating a quiz game out of it.  So I made an quiz game with a timer and scores.  The scores makes it fun for me, while the timer is a time constrain and force me to think on my feet.

## Credit
I recieved help Meg Meyers with localStorage, however towards the end I changed into a JSON approach, and recieved help from Diarmuid Murphy with the adding to list and displaying it in highscore.

## What-I-would-like-to-try
I would like to change up the code a little and test out:

different sort algorithm like insertion sort, and merge sort

insertion for faster sorting then bubble sort

and merge sort for larger data set

splice(0,5) method to make a top 5 high score list instead of it keep adding more scores to list

add key event so it would only input letters into initials inputs 

add Math.floor(Math.random()*objectVariable) to randomize questions and options
